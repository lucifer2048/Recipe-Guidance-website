<h1 id="food">MALABAR CHICKEN DUM BIRIYANI</h1>
<center><img src="malabar.jpg"><br>
Malabar chicken dum biryani is a popular Indian dish, particularly in the South Indian state of Kerala. 
It is a flavorful and aromatic dish that consists of long-grain basmati rice cooked with chicken, 
spices, and herbs. The dish is typically made by layering the chicken masala and partially 
cooked rice in a pot or pan, and then sealing it with a lid and cooking 
it over a low flame. This slow-cooking process allows the flavors to blend together 
and results in a rich and delicious biryani.The Malabar region of Kerala is known for 
its unique blend of spices, which are used in this dish to give it a distinct and flavorful taste. 
The chicken is typically marinated in a spice mix and then cooked with onions, 
tomatoes, and other spices until it is tender and juicy. 
The rice is cooked separately with a blend of spices and herbs, and then 
layered with the chicken masala to create a delicious biryani that is perfect 
for special occasions or as a hearty meal.</center>
